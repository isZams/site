### k8s versions update

Our examples that requires `metallb` no more use `oppenssl`. It was achived by updating `metallb` to latest version which is not compatible with `v1.18`, `v1.19`.

- Dropped testing on k8s v1.18, v1.19. 
- Added testing on k8s v1.25.
- Other versions have been updated to latest patches.
