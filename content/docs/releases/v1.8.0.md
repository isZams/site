### go generics are available for NSM devs

Added support for generic code for all NSM repos! Previously we've moved to go 1.18/1.19, but our third-party deps were not able to work with them. The problem was fixed, and now we're ready to use go generics in NSM!

See more details in https://github.com/networkservicemesh/sdk/pull/1419

### SRI-OV fixes

Since we've started work with adding support for tagged trafic over VLAN SRI-OV interfaces, we've found and fixes a few serious problems in SRI-OV chain elements.

See more details in https://github.com/networkservicemesh/sdk-sriov/issues/489

### Dynamic vl3 DNS

Now not only NSM connections can be changed on the fly, but DNS configurations in vl3 networks too! 

vl3 DNS was powered by NSM monitor API.

See more details in https://github.com/networkservicemesh/sdk/pull/1416

### Error handling

It is very important that users can independently determine the cause of the breakdown and try to fix it, for this we improved error messages and took care of their control.



Before:
```
2023/02/01 06:58:13 [ERROR] [ExcludedPrefixesClient:Request] Source or destination IPs are overlapping with excluded prefixes, srcIPs: [a.16.0.100/32], dstIPs: [b.16.0.103/32], excluded prefixes: [], error: invalid CIDR address: a.16.0.100/32
```

After:
```

2023/02/01 06:59:29 [ERROR] [ExcludedPrefixesClient:Request] Source or destination IPs are overlapping with excluded prefixes, srcIPs: [a.16.0.100/32], dstIPs: [b.16.0.103/32], excluded prefixes: [], error: failed to parse a.16.0.100/32 as CIDR: invalid CIDR address: a.16.0.100/32

Error:

```

### Update vpp


The vpp version has been updated for all vpp based applications. This improved performance and fixed several instabilities.

See more details in https://github.com/networkservicemesh/cmd-forwarder-vpp/issues/802


### nsmctl improvements

Implemented and add support for new cmds that simplifies the debug process of NSM clusters/environments:

```
  get/connections --domain @domain
  get/netwrorkservice --domain @domain
  get/netwrorkserviceendpoints  --domain @domain
  create/netwrorkservice --domain @domain
  create/netwrorkserviceendpoints --domain @domain
```

See more details in 

```bash
$ go install github.com/networkservicemesh/nsmctl@latest
$ nsmctl --help
$ nsmctl get --help
$ nsmctl describe --help
$ nsmctl create --help
$ nsmctl delete --help
```
