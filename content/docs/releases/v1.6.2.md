## Changes since v1.6.1

### Stability improvements / bug fixes

We faced with a problem when an NSE and the k8s-registry handling its registration are both hosted by the same worker, then loss of said worker will result in the NSE Custom Resource to remain in etcd.

[See more details](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/cmd-registry-k8s/issues/376)
