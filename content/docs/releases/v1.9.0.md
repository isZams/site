# NSM v1.9.0


NSM v1.9.0 has been successfully [integration tested](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/integration-k8s-kind/actions/runs/4915412334) with Kubernetes versions:
- v1.27.1
- v1.26.3
- v1.25.8
- v1.24.6
- v1.23.12
- v1.22.13
- v1.21.14
- v1.20.15


NSM v1.9.0 has been tested on:
- [GKE](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/integration-k8s-gke/actions/runs/4915412146)
- [AKS](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/integration-k8s-aks/actions/runs/4915413249)
- [AWS/AWS IPv6](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/integration-k8s-aws/actions/runs/4915412906)
- [Bare metal in Equinix Metal](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/integration-k8s-packet/actions/runs/4915413117)
- [Interdomain GKE/AWS/AKS](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/integration-interdomain-k8s/actions/runs/4915413214)



## Added AF_XDP support


Now cmd-forwarder-vpp able to use AF_PACKET to bind to an existing node interface using LinkToAfPacket


AF_XDP is faster than AF_PACKET, but AF_XDP is only usable for our purposes from kernel version 5.4 onward. The good news is that lots of places have kernel versions that are new (including the more recent version of Docker Desktop).



See more details at https://github.com/networkservicemesh/cmd-forwarder-vpp/issues/283



## Make SRIOV VFs to push/pop tags like vlan or vxlan


Now forwarder vpp is able to program the PF (physical interface) so that the VF (virtual interface) push/pops the correct vlan or vxlan tags. It is working whether or not the mechanism the VF is using is kernel or vfio. VLAN tag is not pushed by software in the kernel, we are programming the PF so that the particular VF is having its vlan tag push/popped in hardware by the NIC.

## Floating interdomain/ Interdomain NSE composition example


Created an interdomain version of the [NSE Composition example](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/deployments-k8s/tree/v1.9.0/examples/features/nse-composition). The difference with the single cluster example is that the first half of NSEs are running on the first cluster, and the second half are running on the second cluster.


See more details in https://github.com/networkservicemesh/deployments-k8s/issues/8874


## Added support for DNS PTR records


A pointer (PTR) record resolves an IP address (made up of numbers and decimals) into a domain name (such as okta.com).


The act of translating an IP address into a domain name is known as a "reverse lookup" in the Domain Name System (DNS).


Now it is supported in vl3 DNS.


See more details in https://github.com/networkservicemesh/sdk/issues/1425


## Interdomain DNS examples


We considered and tested the next scenarios:


1. Interdomain DNS
NSE has coredns sidecar. NSC should be able to resolve the DNS address specified in the NSE coredns config. Look at https://github.com/networkservicemesh/deployments-k8s/tree/main/examples/features/dns


2. Floating interdomain DNS
The same as Interdomain DNS, but NSE is registered in the floating registry


3. Floating interdomain VL3 DNS
Look at - https://github.com/networkservicemesh/deployments-k8s/tree/main/examples/multicluster/usecases/floating_vl3-basic
Look at - https://github.com/networkservicemesh/deployments-k8s/tree/main/examples/features/vl3-dns
NSC should be able to reach other NSCs using vl3 DNS.


And finally we get next new examples:


1. https://github.com/networkservicemesh/deployments-k8s/tree/v1.9.0/examples/multicluster/usecases/floating_dns


2. https://github.com/networkservicemesh/deployments-k8s/tree/v1.9.0/examples/multicluster/usecases/floating_vl3-dns


3. https://github.com/networkservicemesh/deployments-k8s/tree/v1.9.0/examples/multicluster/usecases/interdomain_dns




## Get rid of cloudtest in the interdomain repository


We no longer use `cloudtest` tool in interdomain testing. From this moment on, we're using cloud provider commands directly in the integraiton-interdomain-k8s repository.


It makes our CI more simple and allows folks to simply reproduce our interdomain scenario on public clusters.



## Spire update


Updated spire dependency since:


1. k8s-workload-registrar has been deprecated and removed in the SPIRE 1.6 release, and SPIRE Controller Manager is included instead.


2. SPIRE Community is no longer releasing GCR images in favor of scratch images on GHCR, thus the official image path changed to that.


See more details in
https://github.com/networkservicemesh/deployments-k8s/pull/8963


## Improve UX of examples

Improved and simplified examples with next changes:


1. Namespaced from examples moved to `kustomization` files.
2. Fixed refs: use relative paths in `kustomization` files
3. Fixed refs: use refs to `kustomization` files where we used `kubeclt apply -f .`
3. Avoided creating temporary files for configs. For example, use`kubectl apply -f - <<EOF` instead of
https://github.com/networkservicemesh/deployments-k8s/blob/873559c602aab6ad43223927ea2f29d2dfb09478/examples/multicluster/dns/README.md#L131
4. Avoided using environment variables for kubeconfig. Fixed for use `--kubeconfig=$KUBECONFIG1` instead of `export KUBECONFIG=$KUBECONFIG1`
5. Avoided using environment variables for `kubectl exec`. Instead of:
```
NSC=$(kubectl get pods -l app=alpine -n ns-kernel2kernel --template '{{range .items}}{{.metadata.name}}{{"\n"}}{{end}}')
kubectl exec ${NSC} -n ns-kernel2kernel -- ping -c 4 172.16.1.100
```
We can use
```
kubectl exec pods/alpine -n ns-kernel2kernel -- ping -c 4 172.16.1.100
```
6.Replaced using `bases` with `resources` in `kustomization` files. [Bases is deprecated](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/blob/2a8a17e3af263c8cd61452bd2fc5e2e7d7bc5330/api/types/kustomization.go#L85-L88)
