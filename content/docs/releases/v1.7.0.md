## Planned Enhancements

### Zero trusted registry services

Added [the Path](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1QU5FEq7QloLqEjJs-MMMWvcgPzkz6j-OYk-9k2gDTjc/edit#slide=id.g73e6edae28_0_0) for registry services.

The main difference registry Path with netowkrservice Path is we don't store the Path in the registry models.
Instead of it, we added a public and private Path.

The public path is a human-readable slice of strings that represents the Path of registry IDs that which model visited to reach the final registry. 

See public path definition in this [commit](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/api/commit/30ff0ca88ee87b82f4418d0e95cf08d37d255c6c).

The private path is a data structure that is transported in grpcmetadata and contains all required information to be processed by OPA.

So public path is needed for these goals:

1. Restore a restarting registry client's pods such as endpoints or forwarders.
2. Prevent replacement entries in the final registry by spy registry clients from aboard.

### Add a new remote mechanism 'IPSec'

Added a new remote mechanism for [IPSec](https://wiki.debian.org/IPsec) interfaces.


Now NSM supports the next remote mechanisms: [`Wireguard`, `IPSec`, `Vxlan`]. 
Note that `Wireguard`, `IPSec` both work with L3 and which means that you will need to configure a forwarder on the cluster to prefer which mechanism has more priority for you to use by default for IP services.


### Implement generator for NSE

Added a simple command for `nsmctl` that allows generating endpoints.

Try it by yourself:

```bash
$ go install github.com/networkservicemesh/nsmctl@latest
$ nsmctl gen nse --name 'my-endpoint' --path './my-endpoint'
```

### Add support for IPv6 k8s clusters

Added a support for IPv6 clusters.

Note: Previously we added the support for [IPv6 networks](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/deployments-k8s/tree/main/examples/features/ipv6/Kernel2Kernel_ipv6) that we tested on IPv4 clusters.

Now NSM is working with IPv4 and IPv6 networks on IPv6 and IPv4 clusters.

### Improve UX for NSM examples

Improved and simplified NSM examples by reducing the count of repeatable setups and also made sure that we're using webhook in each example (where it's possible).

[See mote details](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/deployments-k8s/issues/7673)

### Make debugging easier

We considered a new way for users who don't want to read a ton of logs to get connection statuses.
Instead of reading logs, we're suggesting adding a command `nsmctl status` to get a human-readable status of control and data plane.

[See more details](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/nsmctl/issues/3)


### Improve system stabitly
