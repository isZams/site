- [GKE](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/integration-k8s-gke/actions/runs/3177828797)
- [AKS](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/integration-k8s-aks/actions/runs/3177828898)
- [AWS](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/integration-k8s-aws/actions/runs/3177829567)
- [bare metal in Equinix Metal](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/integration-k8s-packet/actions/runs/3203134720)

## Changes since v1.5.0


### OPA integration for registries services

Added the possibility to use OPA policies for registry services.

[See more details](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/sdk/issues/269)

The next step is to add the possibility to be zero trust.

[See at discussion](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/api/pull/147#issuecomment-1259996795)


### Add support for scaling k8s NSM registry

Improved NSM resiliency and availability via a new possibility to scale NSM k8s registry.

[See more details](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/deployments-k8s/issues/6779)

### Add cluster-info examples

Added an interdomain example on selecting endpoints via [k8s about api](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/about-api)

[Example](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/deployments-k8s/tree/main/examples/floating_interdomain/usecases/FloatingVl3-scale-from-zero)

### SR-IOV enablement on Equinix Metal n3 servers

Equinix Metal is planning to make SR-IOV a default configuration on our [new n3 class of servers](https://feedback.equinixmetal.com/changelog/sr-iov-enabled-by-default-on-n3xlarge-servers).

Improved [integration-k8s-packet](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/integration-k8s-packet) to use new n3 class of servers.

### Simplify deployments-k8s examples

Simplified NSM examples via getting rid of creating dynamic files.

[See more details](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/deployments-k8s/issues/5436)


### Public cluster testing via clusterctl

This makes our builds consistent and repeatable across a wide variety of infrastructure environments.

Mmigrate next repos to the `clusterctl`
- integration-k8s-packet

## Remove cloudtest usage

`cloudtest` tool is no longer used in single cluster testing.

Removed `cloudtest` usage from repos:
- integration-k8s-aws
- integration-k8s-gke
- integration-k8s-aks

Now all setup/cleanup logic is extremely simple to be reproducible!

### Show demos with L7 Meshes integration


Showed NSM+L7 mesh integrations:

- [Kuma over vL3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=130&v=tAToaSGaUcM&feature=youtu.be)
- [Consul over vL3](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/deployments-k8s/tree/main/examples/interdomain/nsm_consul_vl3)

On public working group calls!
